The "core" event slots are 2-5pm which should be convenient for all time zones to join. 

Developer streams are invited to keep working together beyond core hourse (e.g., before 2pm or after 5pm UTC), depending on time zones and availability. This can be done by joining the stream's discord channel and/or arranging additional joint working hours per stream.

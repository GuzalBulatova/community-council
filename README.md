# Community council 
This is the repository for sktime's community council (CC). To find out more about the work of the CC, please read our [governance document](https://sktime.org/governance.html).

## Meetings
We hold regular meetings that the full community is welcome to attend. 

* Our meetings are held on our discord server in the #community-council voice channel. To attend, click on this link: https://discord.com/invite/gqSab2K.
* The date and agenda for the next meeting is available in [`AGENDA.md`](https://github.com/sktime/community-council/blob/master/AGENDA.md) and will be discussed in each meeting.
* If you want to add an agenda item to the meeting, [update](https://github.com/sktime/community-council/edit/master/AGENDA.md) the agenda (this will create a PR) and make sure you attend the meeting.
* All meetings are logged and available in [`previous_meetings/`](https://github.com/sktime/community-council/tree/master/previous_meetings).

Meetings

We hold regular meetings that the full community is welcome to attend.

* The date and agenda for the next meeting is available in `AGENDA.md <https://github.com/sktime/community-council/blob/master/AGENDA.md>`__ and will be discussed in each meeting.
* If you want to add an agenda item to the meeting, `update <https://github.com/sktime/community-council/edit/master/AGENDA.md>`__ the agenda (this will create a PR) and make sure you attend the meeting.

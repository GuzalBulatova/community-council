Time series are ubiquitous in real-world applications, but often add considerable complications to the standard data scientific workflows. What's more, most available machine learning toolboxes, like scikit-learn, are limited to the tabular setting, and cannot easily be applied to time series. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to extend and apply common machine learning techniques to time series. 

This is a beginner-friendly tutorial: we assume familiarity with scikit-learn, but no prior time series experience. 

To start, we'll give a clear overview of time series and distinguish between different kinds of time series data and learning tasks, such as forecasting and time series classification. 

You'll then learn about how common machine learning approaches can be extended to time series, including

* State-of-the-art algorithms for time series classification and regression, 
* Reduction strategies, i.e. solving a complex learning tasks by decomposing it into simpler tasks, e.g. solving forecasting via regression,
* Composite strategies like ensembling and pipelining, as well as data transformations like detrending and feature extraction. 

To illustrate the presented approaches, we'll make use of interactive Jupyter notebooks and sktime, a new scikit-learn compatible toolbox for machine learning with time series (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime).  

As sktime developers, we’re actively looking for new contributors, and the tutorial will be an excellent opportunity to get involved!

In sum, you'll learn about
* Different kinds of time series data and learning tasks,
* State-of-the-art algorithms,
* Composition and reduction approaches,
* sktime, a new open-source machine learning toolbox for time series.

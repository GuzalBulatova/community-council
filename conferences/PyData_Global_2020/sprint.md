## How to get started 
Welcome to sktime's sprint at the [PyData Global](https://global.pydata.org) 2020 - we're actively looking for new contributors and your help is extremely welcome!

To get started, read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Make sure to take a look at our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst) too. 

If you get stuck or have a question, please comment on the relevant issue, or chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sktime/community) or our [discord server](https://discord.gg/gqSab2K).

## What to work on
We here suggest a few topics to work on, but please don't hesitate to propose your own topic!

We have labelled beginner-friendly issues with the [good-first issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue) tag, feel free to pick up any of those. 

We also list a few more projects to work on during the sprint below:

### Beginner
* üî¨ User testing: play around with the [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples), try to understand the code, and give us feedback! You can launch the notebooks on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alan-turing-institute/sktime/master?filepath=examples) without having to install anything! For example, which time series classifier achieves the best performance on the arrow head problem? Which forecaster achieves the best performance on the airline data set?
* üìö Improve our [online documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime/api_reference.html) - many classes and methods have missing doc strings!
* üìñ Improve our [example notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples) - make them more engaging and instructive.

### Intermediate 
* ‚öôÔ∏è Take a look at our [good-first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/labels/good%20first%20issue) and pick one that interests you!
* üöß Improve our dev ops, see [#196](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/196) (dev ops skills)
* üíª Enhance our [website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/sktime) (web development skills)
* üíª Refactor [time series classifiers](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/sktime/classification) into [regressors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/sktime/regression), see [#212](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/212)

### Advanced
* üß∞ Create interfaces to other toolboxes like [gluon-ts](https://github.com/awslabs/gluon-ts) or [fbprophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)
* üé® Pick a topic from our [development roadmap](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/228) and propose an API design - for examples, see previous [enhancement proposals](https://github.com/sktime/enhancement-proposals/tree/master/steps)

## How to find out more
If you haven't done so already, watch our [online tutorial at PyData Amsterdam](https://github.com/sktime/sktime-tutorial-pydata-amsterdam-2020) to become familiar with sktime. Alternatively, work through our [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/tree/master/examples). 

## Stay involved
Our goal, apart from improving sktime, is to onboard new contributors and we would really like you to stay around after the sprint. Take a look at our [mentorship programme](https://www.sktime.org/en/latest/mentoring.html) and get in touch if you're interested!

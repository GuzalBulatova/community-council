# sktime - a Unified Framework for Machine Learning with Time Series

## Abstract
Time series are ubiquitous in real-world applications, and often add considerable complications to data science workflows. Popular frameworks like scikit-learn often focus on tabular data and are not easily applicable to time series learning problems.

We present sktime [1]_, a new unified framework for machine learning with time series. sktime provides dedicated time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools for building, tuning and validating models.
In this talk, we'll focus on aspects of practical machine learning with time series. In particular, you'll learn about:

* Why we develop a unified framework and the main advantages of sktime over other toolboxes like statsmodels, 
tsfresh or fbprophet,
* What machine learning with time series is, i.e. the different learning tasks that arise in a temporal data settings, such as forecasting and time series classification/regression, and common machine learning approaches to solve them,
* How sktime extends scikit-learn to time series data, including reduction (e.g. solving a more complex task by decomposing it into simpler tasks) and other composition strategies.

##Â Short summary
We present sktime, a unified framework for machine learning with time series. sktime provides dedicated time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools for building, tuning and validating models. We highlight different time series learning problems such as forecasting and time series classification, algorithms to solve them, and sktime's key features that allow to build extend tools like scikit-learn to time series data.
